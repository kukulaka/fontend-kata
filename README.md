## About this project

This project is a file explorer app. The web page will be able to: 
 - [x] Display the files and folders on the webpage
 - [ ] Allow a user to expand a folder to see it's contents - have added an expander for this but have not implimented the subfiles. There is a surprise instead :smile_cat:!
 - [x] Sort by name/ /size / date
 - [X] Filter by filename

This project with bootstrapped with the React Typescript template and uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/). 
Also used is [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) for UI. 

```files.json``` is found in public folder as in most usual instances data is retrieved from an API and not a local JSON file. 

Some TDD implimented but also wanted to show some features.
